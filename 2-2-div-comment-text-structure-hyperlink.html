  <h1>Adding comment</h1>
  <!-- comment format is like this! -->

  <h1>Text-based elements(tags)</h1>

  <h2>Headings</h2>
  We can use different headings tags h1, h2 and etc. to orgnize our text.

  <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
  <p>
    This is the first paragraph!
  </p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph!</p>

  <h2>Bold text commands</h2>
  <p>
    To write <strong>BOLD</strong> text, which has a significant importance semantically, we use this command.Other way is to use <b>this command</b> to write bold text. Semmantically less important than previous case.
  </p>

  <h2>Italic text commands</h2>
  The <em>Italic</em> elements or tags are also two. We can aslo write it <i>in this way</i>, which indicates semmantically less important text than previous way.

  <h1 id="topStructuralElements">Structural elements(tags)</h1>
  We can use these types of tags to give meaning (semantics) to the organization of our pages. In the past, we could only use divisions for all these purposes.

  <h1>Adding hyperlink</h1>
  <p>
    Adding hyperlink like the image is an in-line level element(tag). The tag begins with <b>&lt;a</b>. Then with the <b>href</b> <i>attribute</i> we put our target link. Before self-closing the tag with <b>/&gt;</b>, we can dedicate a name to our lin by adding the name in between <b>&gt;&nbsp;&lt;</b>.

  <h2>Opening link in new window!!</h2>
  <p>
    For deciding where a link should be opened, we can use the <b>target</b> <i>attribute</i>.

    <a href="https://www.varzesh3.com/" target="_blank" title="Varzesh3">Opening Varzesh3 in a new tab!</a>
  </p>
  <h2>Linkng to parts of the same page</h2>
  <p>
    First, we must set a name with the <b>id</b> <i>attribute</i> i a tag which we want to go to that. Then refer to it as by hyperlink and using <b>#</b> in the <b>href</b> <i>attribute</i>.
