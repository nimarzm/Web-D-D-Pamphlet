# Web-D-D-Pamphlet
<p>
  I have just started learning how to design and develop a web page.
  This is a pamphlet that I wrote simultaneously as I was proceeding with the online specialization of <b>"Web design for everybody: basics of web development and coding"</b> presented by the University of Michigan in the Coursera platform.<br>
  This specialization is divided into 4 courses as listed below:
<ul>
  <li>Basics: Introduction to HTML5</li>
  <li>Styling: Introduction to CSS3</li>
  <li>Interactivity with JavaScript</li>
  <li>Advanced styling with responsive design</li>
</ul>
